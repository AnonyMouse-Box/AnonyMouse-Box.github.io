So, I've tweaked about my github repos a fair bit, everything has a much more slimmed down appearance. Although it's probably relatively easy to sort out when you know how, I decided not to bother trying to get gitea and github to talk to one another, passing updates and such.

Instead I have opted to simply use the two accounts for different things, the gitea - on deskpotato for now - will hold all my personal projects since I can keep it private. Github on the other hand will handle all the public facing stuff to be shared.
This means I have copied the code-can repo across to gitea and removed it from here, I've also deleted the hello-world repo as that has now served it's purpose.
The web facing one would've been far more difficult to replicate elsewhere and having it here allows me to use it as a decentralized testbed for webpages.
As for the rest, that'll have to wait for the next post...
