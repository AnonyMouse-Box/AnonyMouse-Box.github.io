Yup, that's right, we've moved. There was some... unpleasantness... involving the domain I was using, turns out you don't get much for free. As such I have altered my username and dropped back on the github hosting for the time being.

There should come a time in the near future when I get myself a new domain, reset up my main webserver and move everything over to the new domain but not just yet. Curious about the recent silence? Wait till the next blog post and some, though probably not all of the answers will be given.
