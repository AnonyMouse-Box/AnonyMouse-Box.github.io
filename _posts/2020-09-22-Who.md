So, the inevitable question, who am I? Well exactly you may never know, there are some that do but I prefer to keep an air of anonymity between the various things I do. However for you to trust my words and opinions there are things about me you can know without needing to know me personally.

As of the moment I'm an IT professional, more specifically I have five years experience in the field of networking and systems administration. I've been using Linux for around seven years now so I'm getting fairly proficient with it and as you can probably see from my projects I know my way around scripting and software of various kinds.

In addition to this I'm studying for a degree in Cyber Security, so you might say I know my stuff but it's also fair to say I've a lot to learn. I have many strong opinions on just about every subject you can think of, but you'll probably never see them as the intent here is to keep the blog technical, but more on that next time.
