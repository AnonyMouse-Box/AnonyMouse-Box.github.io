So, what is this, well, it's a technical blog, a place for all things computer related to be discussed and thoughts expressed. Now it probably seems a bit weird to stick this on a github repo, especially given I have plenty of experience running webservers. The reason is this is unlikely to be it's final form, here I will iron out the flaws establish a format and a brand before washing away the dirt caused by a messy creative birth.

Yes that means these posts will probably only be available for a limited time, exactly when they will disappear depends upon when I get the main server running comfortably and I feel like I have established something. But enough about what may not come to pass, this site is a Github Pages site built on top of a Github Repository, it uses Jekyll to build the structure and a theme to give it its colour and styling. Its a pretty easy way to build a website if that's something you're interested in doing and makes a handy focal point to host the details of my various projects.

You may also notice I've pointed my domain at it to get a unique domain name for it not rely on the github DNS infrastructure. This makes for a more cohesive feel for my website by sharing a name and forming a development arm. The ultimate purpose of course is a simple technical blog that allows me to write down cohesive ideas and share them with the community so others might benefit from them.
