When, it's a reasonable question, when do I plan to post here? Well so far it's been every night since I started the drive to begin blogging, but the goal is more like once a week, I mostly wanted to get in the habit of writing posts so I don't forget. As for when the replacement blog will be set up, no idea, how long is a piece of string? The work on the server is in progress, and I've set this sort of thing up before, but there are some complexities to figure out, and I'm more focusing on getting some basic blogging skills down first.

Sure, it may seem like I'm perfectly eloquent, but speaking frankly and specifically about a particular subject matter on the internet is not something I'm very used to doing. I naturally have a significant tendency to wander off topic which can be interesting sometimes but not very helpful at keeping the posts insightful and short.
