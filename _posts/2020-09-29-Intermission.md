As you can no doubt see, I have a bit of a a theme going, well it's time to take a break. There's two reasons for this, firstly I've missed a few days, secondly though not unrelated is I've been rather busy. This is partly due to dropping back into study mode, but mostly because I've been investigating some interesting things, so let me tell you about some of those...

I've been reading around about programmer's dvorak keyboard layout and become rather fascinated with it as a way to type faster, more efficiently and with less rsi's. In fact I've become so intrigued am actually typing on it now, typing is slow but I'm picking it up fast and am aiming for much faster speeds than I can currently manage on a qwerty. Only big floor I've seen so far is the fact that typically it's US only meaning no Â£ sign.

In addition to this I've been setting up a server for good opsec when playing with the purple hat training tools. It's been an interesting study but also means that I've been very busy so hopefully we should get back to normal soon, which is more than I can say for the global situation :)
