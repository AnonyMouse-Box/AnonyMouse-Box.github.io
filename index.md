Yep, that's me, this entire hub is built on Github Pages. It makes it nice and easy for me to throw up pages for all my projects and present them in an aethetically pleasing and user friendly way. As you'll see above there is a blog covering development of this site, I have a list of projects below you can investigate, or if you're the more code-oriented type you can click on the links in the box above to go to the relevant Github pages, enjoy!
